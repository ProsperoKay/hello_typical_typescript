# Hello TypeScript

Such a harmless `"hello"` to the acclaimed programming language called Typescript. Best way to go out of your way to make things complicated in your development life.

## Don't learn TypeScript

You know you are in for a disaster if you choose to learn TypeScript; as a beginner of course 😒. The prerequisite list can literally crash a raspberry pi. If you've got no idea this means don't bother finding out; stick to a language you can grasp quickly 🐍.

## Why TypeScript "💗" snakes? 🚫 `type error`

📝 TypeScript has a stricter type system than Python, which means you have to declare the type of every variable and function parameter. Python has dynamic typing, which means the type of a variable can change at any time and is inferred by the interpreter. TypeScript’s type system can help prevent errors and improve performance, but it can also make the code more rigid and less flexible.
